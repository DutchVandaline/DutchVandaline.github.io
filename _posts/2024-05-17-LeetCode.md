I've started doing LeetCode. Of course, it's free plan but, if I get interest I will buy the premium version. Today is the first time so I am doing Explore. I am writing blog simultaniously like in "The Social Network".

# What I've Learned (After today's problems)
First, I've learned that I can use **ArrayList** in java. `List<String> arr = new ArrayList<>()`.<br>
Second, we can use knowledge operand to check if it's odd or even. `num & 1` has the same meaning as `num % 2` and `num >> 2` can be used as `num / 2`. <br>
Third, **Linked List** is a list that has the number and pointer. So, we cannot know the full length of Linked List.<br>
Fourth, by maximizing the usage of Linked List, we can use **two pointers** to check end of list and middle of list. When full length of list increases by 2, the middle value increases.

### Disclaimer
 My LeetCode is free plan. I am posting just the free algorithms for now on. Also, I am using JAVA to code.

# 383. Ransom Note
### Solution
 So, Hashmap approach. This question is about hashmap. Splitting all the char values in String and finding if it matches or not. It's simple when we use array or list but takes a long time.<br>
 Here, we are using hashmap. For each characters on the String, we can count how many characters were found. We can check if `magazine` is including each characters.
 ```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public boolean canConstruct(String ransomNote, String magazine) {
    	HashMap<Character, Integer> magazineLetters = new HashMap<>();
    	
    	for(int i = 0; i<magazine.length(); i++) {
    		char m = magazine.charAt(i);
    		
    		int currentCount = magazineLetters.getOrDefault(m,0);
    		magazineLetters.put(m, currentCount + 1);
    		}
    	for(int i = 0; i<ransomNote.length(); i++) {
    		char r = ransomNote.charAt(i);
    		
    		int currentCount = magazineLetters.getOrDefault(r,0);
    		
    		if(currentCount == 0) {
    			return false;
    		}
    		magazineLetters.put(r,  currentCount - 1);
    	}
    	return true;
    }
}
 ```
Hashmap saves Key and Value in pair. Hashmap has a advantage of fast searching. `getOrDefault()` is for retrieving value rather than null.
We can set by `getOrDefault(r,0)` then null value is retrived as zero. It's not easy. I need to review the hashmap and other sort of things in java.<br>
