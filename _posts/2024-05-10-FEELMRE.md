In the movie "The Social Network", when Mark Zuckerberg( *Jesse Eisenberg* ) was in Harvard and got dumped by Erica( *Rooney Mara* ) he goes straight back to dormitory and starts programming. He breaks into php server, got access to database, crawls the image of students and makes service named "Facemash". I like this scene. It perfectly builds our protagonist and definately, shows how developers work.<br>
But, in that scene the coolest part is that Mark is developing and blogging simultaniously. So, the blog which is brain or emotional trash can for Mark, is the base of "Facebook". **Speaking of which, I wanted to do that.** 
<br>

### Disclaimer
 **FEELM** is an application that I've been building using Flutter/Dart. It's cross-platform app which recommends you the movie based on your daily mood.
 I thank Director David Fincher for directing cool movie. 

### 2024-05-10
 Developing **FEELM** was a challenge for me a long time ago. I wasn't good at using Dart. Flutter or Android Studio or things like that. I was young, bold,
but not a good developer. About 2 years have passed from back then, I've re-run the app again. I've changed some part and thought it's not bad back then.
Yeah. It's not that bad... I realized that *It sucked*. How on earth did I thought to deploy this app at the App Store and boast myself to my friends?
I really needed to Re-build this app again. <br>
<br>

### Problems
 There are few problems going on here.<br>

 ### Dart changed
 ```dart
  ...
 class MainTheme {
  ThemeData get theme => ThemeData(
        brightness: Brightness.dark,
        textTheme: TextTheme(
          headline1: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 25.0, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
          headline2: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 20.0),
          headline3: TextStyle(color: Colors.black, fontSize: 20.0),
          ...
 ```
 Dart language has been changed. There are no more headline1, or bodytext1 things like that. The ways of making theme file has been changed. That's one problem.

 ### Big Difference between deployed version
This is the main problem. I've touched FEELM before. And I didn't make with a new version. So, the code what I am seeing is different from the app that is deployed.
So, there is no turning back to rebuild from the scratch. Actually, I've been thinking that this app has so implicit limitations. It's local, no Artificial Intelligence used for recommendation system, static, non-optimized UI/UX. It was a toy project for me and I was growing as a developer so, it was natural. <br>
  And I need an idea to make this app cool and useful. Not like a toy project.
