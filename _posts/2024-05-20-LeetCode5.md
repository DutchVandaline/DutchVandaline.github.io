# What I've Learned
**First**, checking inside a array can be simple as playing with two pointers and using original array.

### Disclaimer
 My LeetCode is free plan. I am posting just the free algorithms for now on. Also, I am using JAVA to code.

# 27. Remove Element

### My Solution
This question was similar to what I've solved yesterday, *26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array*. I've changed some of bit and solved. Main algorithm is to check the current and value, adding it to existing `nums`. 

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        int j =0;
        for(int i =0; i<nums.length; i++) {
        	if(nums[i] != val) {
        		nums[j] = nums[i];
        		j++;
        	}
        }
        return j;
    }
}

```

# 28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String

### My Solution
This question is easy. Finding string inside another string. There is already a method in java. It wasn't hard to solve.

```java
class Solution {
    public int strStr(String haystack, String needle) {
    	int numb = haystack.indexOf(needle);
    	return numb;
    }
}
```
