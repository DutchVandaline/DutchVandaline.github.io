# What I've Learned
**First**, checking inside a array can be simple as playing with two pointers and using original array.

### Disclaimer
 My LeetCode is free plan. I am posting just the free algorithms for now on. Also, I am using JAVA to code.

# 27. Remove Element

### My Solution
This question was similar to what I've solved yesterday, *26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array*. I've changed some of bit and solved. Main algorithm is to check the current and value, adding it to existing `nums`. 

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        int j =0;
        for(int i =0; i<nums.length; i++) {
        	if(nums[i] != val) {
        		nums[j] = nums[i];
        		j++;
        	}
        }
        return j;
    }
}

```

# 28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String

### My Solution
This question is easy. Finding string inside another string. There is already a method in java. It wasn't hard to solve.

```java
class Solution {
    public int strStr(String haystack, String needle) {
    	int numb = haystack.indexOf(needle);
    	return numb;
    }
}
```

# 35. Search Insert Position

### My Solution
I've used `Stack` for this problem. Adding if it's smaller than target and break when it's bigger or same. Then it retrieves the result successfully. It works, but I think this is not the answer what leetcode wants. Due to the expression *You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.*, I think it's binary search. But, I don't know how. 

```java
class Solution {
    public int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {
    	Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
    	int result = 0;
        for(int i =0; i<nums.length; i++) {
        	if(nums[i] < target) {
        		stack.push(nums[i]);
        	} else if(nums[i] > target || nums[i] == target) {
        		break;
        	}
        }
        result = stack.size();
        return result;
    }
}

```
### Solution1
Surprising thing is that there are already `binarySearch` method in Java. Idea is simple. Checking the medium of the array, if it's larger, search bottom half and vice versa.<br>
First solution is not using `binarySearch` method. It's checking target repeateadly and add start or subtract end.

 ```java
class Solution {
    public int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = nums.length-1;

        while (start <= end) {
            int mid = start + (end-start)/2;
            if (nums[mid] == target) return mid;
            else if (nums[mid] > target) end = mid-1;
            else start = mid+1;
        }

        return start;
    }
}
```
<br>

### Solution2
This version is using `binarySearch`. It's fast.

```
class Solution {
    public int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {
        int ans=Arrays.binarySearch(nums,target);
        if(ans<0){
            return -ans-1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
