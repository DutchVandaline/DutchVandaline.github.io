# What I've Learned

### Disclaimer
 My LeetCode is free plan. I am posting just the free algorithms for now on. Also, I am using JAVA to code.

# 344. Reverse String

## My Solution
I solved this problem and the solution was clear. I wasn't able to come up with 2 pointers but I didn't see the solutions. I am proud.

 ```java
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        char temp = 'a';
        for(int i =0; i<s.length/2;i++) {
        	temp = s[i];
        	s[i] = s[s.length-1-i]; 
        	s[s.length-1-i]= temp;
        }
    }
}```
