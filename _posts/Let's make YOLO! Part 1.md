# To Start With
Building RayCaster game using C or making bunch of apps and deploying on AppStore were just to improve my coding skills. I had a dream for making an Artificial Intelligence model. Of course I don't know well about Artificial Intelligence also, I'm not that fluent using PyTorch, too. I think it is necessary to hit the wall or dig some place wrong to build my skills. So, I have a challenge for myself. Before that, following is my skill that I can do with PyTorch: <br>
* Can build CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) using PyTorch.
* Can build TinyVGG using PyTorch.
* Can handle datasets and make dataloaders to train and test.
<br>
The reason why instructors or professors begin with Computer Vision problem for teaching how to write code on Artificial Intelligence is that Computer Vision Problem is visual, straight forward and easy to understand. CNN and TinyVGG is the basic of the Computer Vision and I understand it. Now, I wanted to build a SOTA(State-of-the-art) model on Computer Vision field by myself. A YOLO.

# Thoughts
Idea was simple. Pequod was for every people who were interested in environment. I admit. It was broad, not convincing, ideal. The biggest problem was the target consumers. Pequod is for people who are environmental. It's too broad. So, The first thing we've done is narrowing down the target. We've set for those who have reusable bottle(tumbler) but not using.
<br>

# Development
## Problem
The biggist problem was that there isn't any free map api for coffee shops. I've looked up for Google map, Korean Statistic open map api. But nothing was available. For my first thought, I wanted to target to global tumbler users, but *first, we need to narrow it down* and *second, there is no map api*, chose to target Korean users.
<br>

## Progress
**1. Simple frame of the app.** <br>
**2. Used warm color and placeholder** <br>
I've made the basic frame of the app. There are three screens, *Map screen*, *Home Screen* and *Settings Screen*. It's filled of placeholder for now on. Also, I've used Pequod's theme for the basics. It can be change anytime. Additionally, I've changed the icon size of the bottom navigation bar.
<br>

# Branding
I want to make a brand out of this. There will be further notice when progress is made.
