# To Start With
This is a new project for me and my crew, "A-have". 'Pequod' was the official first project for our team but, I've made every backend server and frontend flutter app also, design by myself. Due to my selfishness, There was no chance for my team mates to join. I've learned a lot from 'Pequod', especially team work. Now, I am recording every progress, development and ideas with my team and those who are watching us.
<br>

# Thoughts
Idea was simple. Pequod was for every people who were interested in environment. I admit. It was broad, not convincing, ideal. The biggest problem was the target consumers. Pequod is for people who are environmental. It's too broad. So, The first thing we've done is narrowing down the target. We've set for those who have reusable bottle(tumbler) but not using.
<br>

# Development
## Problem
The biggist problem was that there isn't any free map api for coffee shops. I've looked up for Google map, Korean Statistic open map api. But nothing was available. For my first thought, I wanted to target to global tumbler users, but *first, we need to narrow it down* and *second, there is no map api*, chose to target Korean users.

## Progress

**1. Simple frame of the app.** <br>
**2. Used warm color and placeholder** <br>
I've made the basic frame of the app. There are three screens, *Map screen*, *Home Screen* and *Settings Screen*. It's filled of placeholder for now on. Also, I've used Pequod's theme for the basics. It can be change anytime. Additionally, I've changed the icon size of the bottom navigation bar.

# Branding
I want to make a brand out of this. There will be further notice when progress is made.
