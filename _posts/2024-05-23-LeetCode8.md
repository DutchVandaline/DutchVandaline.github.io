# What I've Learned
**First**, We can append length of array by `digits = new int[digits.length + 1];`
**Second**, To return in String and for appending, we can use StringBuilder.

### Disclaimer
 My LeetCode is free plan. I am posting just the free algorithms for now on. Also, I am using JAVA to code.

# 9. Palindrome Number Review

## Solution
I was able to come up with the idea of reversing integer, but I didn't know how. Solution was simple. Using `digit` and `temp`. We are multipling and adding reversely by using `int digit`. 

 ```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        if(x < 0){
            return false;
        }

        long reversed = 0;
        long temp = x;

        while(temp != 0){
            int digit = (int) (temp % 10);
            reversed = reversed * 10 + digit;
            temp /= 10;
        }

        return (reversed == x);
    }
}
```

# 70. Climbing Stairs

## Solution
This is hard. I've came up with using Combination. Counting 1s and adding where to fit 2. But, if number gets bigger, it takes longer. So, there is a problem with it. I never thought of recursion so, I wasn't able to solve this problem. I've saw the solution but, surprisingly this solution had problem too. The ** Time Limit Exceeded **.

 ```java
class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if(n==0 || n==1){
            return 1;
        }
        return climbStairs(n-1) + climbStairs(n-2);
    }
}
```

# 66. Plus One

## My Solution
When given ListNode, I need to think about array. `ArrayList<ListNode> arr = ArrayList<>();`. But, this didn't work. It seems it's not working after 3 values.

 ```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode deleteDuplicates(ListNode head) {
    	ArrayList<ListNode> arr = new ArrayList<>();
       arr.add(head);
       head = head.next;
       while(head!=null){
           if(arr.get() == head)
               head = head.next;
           else{
               arr.add(head);
               head = head.next;
           }
       }
       ListNode pointer = arr.getFirst();
       return pointer.next;
    }
}
```

## Solution
By adding `ListNode res`, we can just solve it without importing `ArrayList`. I've never used `head.val` before.

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode deleteDuplicates(ListNode head) {
        ListNode res = head;
       while(head != null && head.next != null){
        if(head.val == head.next.val){
            head.next = head.next.next;
        } else{
            head = head.next;
        }
       }
       return res;
    }
}
```
