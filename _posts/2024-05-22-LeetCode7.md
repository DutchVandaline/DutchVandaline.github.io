# What I've Learned
**First**, We can append length of array by `digits = new int[digits.length + 1];`
**Second**, To return in String and for appending, we can use StringBuilder.

### Disclaimer
 My LeetCode is free plan. I am posting just the free algorithms for now on. Also, I am using JAVA to code.

# 1. Two Sum Review

## My Solution
I thought I could solve this problem with two pointers. But the key of using two pointers is `Arrays.sort(nums);`. When sorted, it's harder to find the key in correct order. That is my problem so, the best answer will be
finding using just hashcode. When saving keys and values reversed to find, the problem happens with `hash.get()`. It searches the value so if there is same value, it retrieves the same. For example, as input of {3,3} and 
target of 6, output should be {0,1} but actually it gives {1,1} back.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
    	HashMap<Integer, Integer> hash = new HashMap<>();
    	for(int i =0; i<nums.length; i++) {
    		hash.put(nums[i], i);
    	}
        int r = 0;
        int l = nums.length -1;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        

        while(r != l){
            if(nums[r] + nums[l] == target){
                break;
            } else if(nums[r] + nums[l] > target){
                l--;
            } else{
                r++;
            }
        }
        return new int[]{r,l};
    }
}

# 67. Add Binary

## Solution
I've never heard of `StringBuilder`. StringBuilder in Java is literally for building string. String is static variable but, String builder is mutable. 
This solution is not simple. I've thought of 'XOR' to solve this but the problem was handling the carry. This solution handles carry with sum. With `sb.append(sum % 2)`, answer is added in the StringBuilder. Final `sb.reverse().toString()` is for reversing.

 ```java
class Solution {
    public String addBinary(String a, String b) {
    	StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    	int i = a.length() - 1;
    	int j = b.length() - 1;    	
    	int carry =0;
    	
    	while(i >= 0 || j >= 0){
    		int sum = carry;
    		if(i >= 0) sum += a.charAt(i) - '0';
    		if(j >= 0) sum += b.charAt(j) - '0';
    		sb.append(sum % 2);
    		carry = sum / 2;
    		
    		i--;
    		j--;
    	}
    	if(carry != 0) sb.append(carry);
    	return sb.reverse().toString();
    }
}

# 69. Sqrt(x)

## My Solution
I've thought of using log but, log doesn't work. Actually, my approach was totally wrong. 

 ```java
class Solution {
    public int sqrt(int x) {
    	int k = (int) baseLog(x, 2);
    	System.out.println(k);
    return k;	
    }
    
    static double baseLog(double x, double base) {
    	return Math.log10(x) / Math.log10(base);
    }
}
```

## Solution
For my surprise, it was binary search. Checking the medium and cutting in half. And reducing one from last and adding one from start. I need to review it again.

 ```java
class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        if (x == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int first = 1, last = x;
        while (first <= last) {
            int mid = first + (last - first) / 2;
            if (mid == x / mid) {
                return mid;
            } else if (mid > x / mid) {
                last = mid - 1;
            } else {
                first = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return last;
    }
}
```
