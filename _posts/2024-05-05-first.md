## Background
The White House urged to stop writing code in C/C++. Due to Garbage Collection, they found a servere safety issue.
I always admired 1990s ~ 2000s developers. Of course, I wasn't alive back then but I have some sort of Nostalgia and admiration on 1990s to 2000s developers. 
For all my respect, I decided to make a fps game using C and OpenGL.

## Disclaimer
This code is written only in C. I used OpenGL to implement the 3D drawing in C.
Shout out to '3D Sage' who gave me an inspiration and way to make a game.

## Code Breakdown
### main.c
```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <glut.h>
#include <math.h>
#include "sprites.h"

#define PI 3.1415926535

float degToRad(float a) { return a * PI / 180.0; }
float FixAng(float a) { if (a > 359) { a -= 360; } if (a < 0) { a += 360; } return a; }
float distance(ax, ay, bx, by, ang) { return cos(degToRad(ang)) * (bx - ax) - sin(degToRad(ang)) * (by - ay); }
float px, py, pdx, pdy, pa;
float frame1, frame2, fps;

int currentFrame = 0;
float frameDuration = 200; // Duration each frame is displayed in milliseconds
float lastFrameSwitch = 0;

typedef struct
{
    int w, a, d, s;                     
}ButtonKeys; ButtonKeys Keys;

```
**degToRad** is a method from <math.h>.<br>
**FixAng** part checks if the angle is between 0 to 360. If angle a is over 359 or 0, it corrects it by adding or subtracting 360.<br>
**distance** function calculates the vector and direction. The result is scalar. If result is positive, then it means ang is in the same direction.<br>
**px, py** is player position.<br>
**ButtonKeys** is for controlling keys. It's written in sturct.<br>
