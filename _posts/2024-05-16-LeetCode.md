<br>
I've started doing LeetCode. Of course, it's free plan but, if I get interest I will buy the premium version. Today is the first time so I am doing Explore. I am writing blog simultaniously like in "The Social Network".
<br>

### Disclaimer
 My LeetCode is free plan. I am posting just the free algorithms for now on. Also, I am using JAVA to code.

# Fizz Buzz
### My solution
 Actually, I didn't know that List and Array was different in java. I really don't have much of algorithm basics. I guess, I can
 develop through doing LeetCode. <br>
 For my excuse, I made a Fizz Buzz code using array easily. It was simple. But, the question didn't want that. They wanted me to
 use List<String>. So, i built it again. <br>
 ```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public List<String> fizzBuzz(int n) {
    	List<String> inputArr = new ArrayList<>();
    	
    	for(int i = 1; i<=n; i++) {
    		if(i % 3 == 0 && i % 5==0)
    			inputArr.add("FizzBuzz");
    		else if(i % 3 == 0)
    			inputArr.add("Fizz");
    		else if(i % 5 == 0)
    			inputArr.add("Buzz");
    		else
    			inputArr.add(String.valueOf(i));
    	}
    	
    	for(String e1 : inputArr) {
    	 System.out.print(e1);
    	}
    	
    	return inputArr;
    	
    }
}

 ```
### Solution

This works, but, runtime takes 23ms. The most propotion of submition has less than mine. The answer was to use boolean.
How can I didn't came up with boolean! <br>
With a simple code of just making `boolean divisibleBy3 = i % 3 ==0`, it makes less.

# 1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero
### My solution
Only limit of free plan on LeetCode is that I cannot use cloud saving and running. I need to open the Eclipse to use JAVA. <br>
Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero. Easy. Not a hard question. Divide in 2 when even, subtract 1 when odd. 
```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfSteps(int num) {
    	int count = 0;
    	while(num != 0) {
    		if(num % 2 == 0)
            	num /=2;
            else
            	num -=1;
    		count++;
    	}
    	
        return count;
    }
}
```
### Solution
Okay, it worked but Leetcode is offering to use shift operator to use less bits. Instead of `num % 2`, we can use `num & 1`.
`num & 1` is for checking the final integer if it's 0 or 1. If it's odd, num's final integer will be 1 and if it's even,
final integer will be 0. So, we can use logical operands to check if it's odd or even. <br>
In the same way, we can use shift operands to divide 2. `num >> 2` is same as `num / 2`. It was used on *Raycaster with C*.

# 876. Middle of The Linked List
### My Solution
Okay, I didn't know about linked list. I just thought that it will be same as array. But, there are few differences. Nodes are the box of number and pointing to next Node. So, we just know the number. There are no index, as a result no middle value. There are few ways to go through this. <br>
I will use ArrayList to save the numbers in Linked List and count up when each work is done. But there are another problem. For given `ListNode` class. I really don't know how to pick on value.
```java
class ListNode {
	int val;
	ListNode next;
	
	ListNode() {}
	ListNode(int val) { 
		this.val = val; 
	}
	ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { 
		this.val = val;
		this.next = next; 
	}
	
}
```
Okay, `int val` is the first number and `ListNode next` is the next ListNode.
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

class ListNode {
	int val;
	ListNode next;
	
	ListNode() {}
	ListNode(int val) { 
		this.val = val; 
	}
	ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { 
		this.val = val;
		this.next = next; 
	}
	
}


class Solution {
    public ListNode middleNode(ListNode head) {
    	ArrayList<ListNode> arr = new ArrayList<>();
    	int count= 0;
    	while(head != null) {
    		arr.add(head);
    		head = head.next;
    		count++;
    	}
        return arr.get(count/2);
    }
}
```
Understanding the structure of ListNode was the key and using arraylist was the key also.

### Solution
Using two pointers which are keep tracking the **last node** and **middle node**. Middle Nodes grows when the length of node increases by two. <br>
length = 3, middle node index = 2 <br>
length = 4, middle node index = 2 <br>
length = 5, middle node index = 3 <br>
```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode middleNode(ListNode head) {

    	ListNode middle = head;
    	ListNode end = head;
    	while(end != null && end.next != null) {
    		middle = middle.next;
    		end = end.next.next;
    	}
    	return middle;
    }
}
```
This is a great idea. I've learn something today.
