<br>
I've started doing LeetCode. Of course, it's free plan but, if I get interest I will buy the premium version. Today is the first time so I am doing Explore. I am writing blog simultaniously like in "The Social Network".
<br>

### Disclaimer
 My LeetCode is free plan. I am posting just the free algorithms for now on. Also, I am using JAVA to code.

# Fizz Buzz
### My solution
 Actually, I didn't know that List and Array was different in java. I really don't have much of algorithm basics. I guess, I can
 develop through doing LeetCode. <br>
 For my excuse, I made a Fizz Buzz code using array easily. It was simple. But, the question didn't want that. They wanted me to
 use List<String>. So, i built it again. <br>
 ```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public List<String> fizzBuzz(int n) {
    	List<String> inputArr = new ArrayList<>();
    	
    	for(int i = 1; i<=n; i++) {
    		if(i % 3 == 0 && i % 5==0)
    			inputArr.add("FizzBuzz");
    		else if(i % 3 == 0)
    			inputArr.add("Fizz");
    		else if(i % 5 == 0)
    			inputArr.add("Buzz");
    		else
    			inputArr.add(String.valueOf(i));
    	}
    	
    	for(String e1 : inputArr) {
    	 System.out.print(e1);
    	}
    	
    	return inputArr;
    	
    }
}

 ```
### Solution

This works, but, runtime takes 23ms. The most propotion of submition has less than mine. The answer was to use boolean.
How can I didn't came up with boolean! <br>
With a simple code of just making `boolean divisibleBy3 = i % 3 ==0`, it makes less.
