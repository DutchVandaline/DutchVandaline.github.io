# What I've Learned
**First**, We can append length of array by `digits = new int[digits.length + 1];`
**Second**, To return in String and for appending, we can use StringBuilder.

 My LeetCode is free plan. I am posting just the free algorithms for now on. Also, I am using JAVA to code.

# 9. Palindrome Number Review

## Solution
I was able to come up with the idea of reversing integer, but I didn't know how. Solution was simple. Using `digit` and `temp`. We are multipling and adding reversely by using `int digit`. 

 ```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        if(x < 0){
            return false;
        }

        long reversed = 0;
        long temp = x;

        while(temp != 0){
            int digit = (int) (temp % 10);
            reversed = reversed * 10 + digit;
            temp /= 10;
        }

        return (reversed == x);
    }
}
```
