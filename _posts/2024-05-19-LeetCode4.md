# What I've Learned
**First**, Sorting alphabetical and comparing between first and last value for continuous characters is astonishing idea. <br>
**Second**, **Stack** I can use stack to check if it matched or not.<br>
**Third**, **HashMap** for mapping two different values. <br>
**Fourth**, **ListNode** has a similar patterns. It uses `while` and `pointer`.
**Fifth**, **double pointers** can be used anywhere.


### Disclaimer
 My LeetCode is free plan. I am posting just the free algorithms for now on. Also, I am using JAVA to code.

# 14. Longest Common Prefix

### My Solution
I came up with comparing the first String with others and put it inside a list, combine at final step. It passed the given test but, when submitting it didn't worked. Problem was that it needs to be continuous. I didn't know how to do it so, I saw the solution.

```java
class Solution {
    public String longestCommonPrefix(String[] strs) {
    	String reference = strs[0];
    	ArrayList<Character> list = new ArrayList<>();
    	boolean add = true;

    	for(int i = 0; i<reference.length(); i++) {
    		for(int j =1; j<strs.length; j++) {
    			if(strs[j].indexOf(reference.charAt(i)) == -1) {
    				add = false;
    				break;
    			}
    				
    			else
    				add = true;
    		}
    		if(add)
    			list.add(reference.charAt(i));
    	}
    	
    	 StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
         for (char c : list) {
             sb.append(c);
         }
    	
    	return sb.toString(); 
    }
}

```
### Solution
This question is tough. Sorting the array and comparing first and last value. Sorting alphabetical. How can I come up with that idea? Sorting and comparing the first and last is something. 

 ```java
class Solution {
    public String longestCommonPrefix(String[] strs) {
        Arrays.sort(strs);
        String s1 = strs[0];
        String s2 = strs[strs.length-1];
        int idx = 0;
        while(idx < s1.length() && idx < s2.length()){
            if(s1.charAt(idx) == s2.charAt(idx)){
                idx++;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return s1.substring(0, idx);
    }
}
```

# 20. Valid Parentheses

### My Solution
At a first glance, I thought it was easy. But, it took few hours to make a wrong answer. It is a tough question if you don't know about stack. I didn't know it too. So, I saw the Solution.

 ```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isValid(String s) {
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
        Map<Character, Character> mapping = new HashMap<>();
        mapping.put(')', '(');
        mapping.put('}', '{');
        mapping.put(']', '[');

        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (mapping.containsValue(c)) {
                stack.push(c);
            } else if (mapping.containsKey(c)) {
                if (stack.isEmpty() || mapping.get(c) != stack.pop()) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }

        return stack.isEmpty();        
    }
}
```
I didn't come up with `stack`. It could be more easier if I used stack. And mapping with hashmap is a great idea. I need to review this question again.

# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

### My Solution
This question is tough. The most confusing part was that returning form seems like an array but actual return type is ListNode. I saw the solution to make my own and wasn't really successful.

```java
class ListNode {
     int val;
     ListNode next;
     ListNode() {}
     ListNode(int val) {
    	 this.val = val; 
    	 }
     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) {
    	 this.val = val; this.next = next; 
    	 }
 }

class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode list1, ListNode list2) {
    	ListNode pointer = new ListNode();
    	ArrayList<ListNode> result_arr = new ArrayList<>();
    	
    	while(list1 != null || list2 != null) {
    		if(list1.val >= list2.val) {
    			result_arr.add(list1);
    			list1 = list1.next;
    		}else {
    			result_arr.add(list2);
    			list2 = list2.next;
    		}
    	}
    	pointer = result_arr.getFirst();    	
    	return pointer.next;
    }
}

```
### Solution
Using dummy pointer. I was thinking of it but, I didn't know how to use it. It seems most of the ListNode question looks alike. Using `while(list1 != null){}` statement and using `dummy parameter`. Also, it's using reference modification. This is tough.

 ```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode list1, ListNode list2) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode();
        ListNode cur = dummy;

        while (list1 != null && list2 != null) {
            if (list1.val > list2.val) {
                cur.next = list2;
                list2 = list2.next;
            } else {
                cur.next = list1;
                list1 = list1.next;
            }
            cur = cur.next;
        }

        cur.next = (list1 != null) ? list1 : list2;

        return dummy.next;        
    }
}
```

# 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

### My Solution
I tried to solve with linked list or array list but, it was impossible. After 30 minutes, I came up with stack solution. First, add first value of nums in stack. Then `continue` if it eqauls the value inside stack or push if it isn't already in stack. I thought it was pretty good solution, but there are better ways.

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
    	Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
    	stack.push(nums[0]);
    	
    	for(int i =1; i<nums.length; i++) {
    		if(stack.contains(nums[i])) 
    			continue;
    		else
    			stack.push(nums[i]);
    	}
        
    	for(int j =0; j<stack.size(); j++) {
    		nums[j] = stack.get(j);
    	}
    	return stack.size();
    }
}

```
### Solution
This is quite simple approach. Using two pointers to check. I still think that I cannot come up with this idea. It's moving one by one through comparing values next to each other.

 ```java
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int j = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != nums[i - 1]) {
                nums[j] = nums[i];
                j++;
            }
        }
        return j;
    }
}
```
